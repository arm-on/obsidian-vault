The **realization** of a random variable (R.V.) is the result of applying the random variable — which is a function from the sample space to the set of possible values — to an observed outcome of a random experiment.
This is what the experimenter actually **records** or **observes** after the experiment.

**Note**: The random variable itself is the process dictating how the observation comes about.

**Example**: 
Consider rolling a fair six-sided die.

- Let the sample space be $S=\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$
- Define the random variable $X$ as the square of the die face value:
$$X(\omega)=\omega^2$$
where $\omega$ is the observed die outcome. 
If the die shows a 4 in one trial ($\omega=4$), then the realization of $X$ is:
$$X(4)=16$$
Here:
- $X$ is the mapping rule (the process)
- $16$ is the realization - the actual value observed for that trial.
