An experiment is a measurement procedure or observation process.

# Types of Experiments


- If the outcome of an experiment is certain, that is the outcome is always the  
same, it is then a **deterministic** experiment.
	 **Example**: Cooling water below **0Â°C**. If water is cooled below its freezing point at normal atmospheric pressure, it will always freeze.

- In a **random** experiment, the outcome may unpredictably vary when the  
experiment is repeated, as the conditions under which it is performed cannot  
be predetermined with sufficient accuracy.
	**Example**: Tossing a Coin. The result is heads or tails.
