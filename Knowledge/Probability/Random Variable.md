A random variable $X$ is a deterministic function $X : S â†’ \mathbb{R}$ that assigns a real number to each outcome in the sample space $S$, i.e. a mapping from the sample space to the set of real numbers $R$.

More precise definition:

A random variable $X$ is a measurable function $X:\Omega\to E$ from a sample space $\Omega$ as a set of possible outcomes to a measurable space $E$. 

The probability that $X$ takes on a value in a measurable set $S \subseteq E$ is written as 
$$\mathbb{P}(X\in S)=\mathbb{P}(\{w\in\Omega | X(w)\in S\})$$
