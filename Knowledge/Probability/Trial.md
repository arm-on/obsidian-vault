In random experiments, the making of each measurement or observation, i.e. each repetition of the experiment, is called a trial.

**Example**: Each time you toss a coin, it is one trial of the experiment.
For instance, tossing a coin 5 times consists of **5 trials**, with each trial producing an outcome from the sample space $\{\text{Heads}, \text{Tails}\}$.
