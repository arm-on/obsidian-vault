An event is a single outcome or a collection of outcomes of an experiment.

An event is a subset of the sample space of an experiment, i.e. a set of one or more sample points, and the symbol { } is used as shorthand for representing an event.

**Example**: Rolling a Dice. The sample space is $\{1,\dots,6\}$. An example event is "rolling an even number": $\{2,4,6\}$.
